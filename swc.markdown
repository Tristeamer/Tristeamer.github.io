Argueably the most popular thing I've made just because of how my friends watch these videos. Here you can find all of the episodes and trailers for Skiing With Christeamer.

**Here's the two episodes/SWC related things I am currently the most proud of making:**

### So this is the dedicated page for Skiing With Christeamerâ„¢

I'll put this page in **ascending** chronological order so that the further down it goes the older (and lower in quality).
## Season 3: Unnammed (so far)
Currently the only Season 3 video is just the trailer for it, editing on it has been started but it's not nearly done.

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h8uz0BFf-X8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Personally I'd say that it's my favourite video that I've edited just because I really tried to make it look somewhat professional.
