A while back I made a couple of texure packs for GD, I figured I should put them here so it's a bit easier to download them. 
Both of these texture packs are for the **PC** version of Geometry Dash and the **High** graphics setting.

**Christeamer Pack V1 (OLD/BAD)**

Sadly I never made a video showcase for this texture pack so I'll just embed some of the texture files instead:

This is the game sheet with most of the textures on it as this texture pack doesn't have any custom icons and is mostly just changing the UI textures.

# How to install Geometry Dash texture packs:

1: Download a texture pack. *(obviously)*

2: Install 7zip from [Here](https://www.7-zip.org/) (The built in .zip tools in windows can work if the pack is in a .zip format but 7zip is just better tbh)

3: Find your texture pack file and right click on it to bring up the context menu, then hover over the **7zip** option and then choose the option to **Extract to "FILENAME\"**, for an example the menu will look like this:

4: After unzipping the texture pack using the **Extract to "FILENAME\"** option you will be left with a new folder containing the texture pack. Navigate to whatever directory the pack files are in (you'll know you're there when you see .png and .plist files!!). Now, open **Steam** and right click on Geometry Dash in your **Steam library**. It will open a small menu, now hover over the manage option and click on the option to **"Browse Local Files"**, it will open a file explorer to wherever you have Geometry Dash installed.

5: Now what you're in the Geometry Dash directory there will be a folder called **"Resources"** containing all of the textures for the game. The only thing left to do is to open the  **"Resources"** folder and copy all of the files from the folder you unzipped into the **"Resources"** folder.

6: You're done! You should now have a texture pack installed.

(7: If you have MegaHack v7 or v6 you can instead just use [PoweredByPie's texture loader](https://github.com/poweredbypie/textureldr/releases) to switch between the texture packs without having to do this.)
